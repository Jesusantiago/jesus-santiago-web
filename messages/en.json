Each move has been a mix of uncertainty, excitement, and lessons that helped me grow far beyond what I expected.",
    "paragraph2": "Since I was a kid, I’ve been drawn to technology. I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started, but anything with a screen fascinated me. Computers, video games, devices… it felt like there was a whole universe inside them, waiting to be explored. Today, years later, I still feel that same wonder—only now, I get to build inside that universe.",
    "paragraph3": "I love programming not just because it’s logical or challenging, but because there’s something deeply satisfying about solving things. You start with a blank idea, hit walls, get frustrated, try again, and suddenly... it works. That moment makes it all worth it. No matter how complex the problem, I enjoy the challenge—because in the end, it always teaches me something new.",
    "paragraph4": "I also have an adventurous side that needs to step out into the real world. I play airsoft, and in the past, I did rock climbing and long hikes. I’ve spent more than 10 days straight in the mountains—and while it may sound intense, those are some of the most meaningful memories I carry with me. Being out there, away from distractions, teaches you to trust yourself, listen to your surroundings, and appreciate the simple things.",
